# Development

The development requires Powershell 5+.

The following scripts are used during development and deployment:

- `setup.ps1`  
Install dependencies for everything.
- `build.ps1`  
Build the module and packages.
- `install.ps1`  
Install the module in the system.
- `publish.ps1`  
Publish module to Powershell Gallery, Chocolatey and Github.


## Build and test

The builded module will be available in the `_build\{version}` directory. Version is by default determined automatically based on the current time.

```
./build.ps1
```

To override default versions use `Version` parameter: `./build -Version 0.0.1`.  
To build and install in the system use  `Install`  parameter: `./build.ps1 -Install`. 

Run `Invoke-Pester` in the root to run [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester) tests.

To clean temporary files created during the build run `git clean -Xdf`.


## Publish

The `publish.ps1` script publishes to Github, PSGallery and Chocolatey. There is a switch parameter for each publishing platform and there is also a parameter for creating a git tag.

```powershell
$v = ./build.ps1   #create a new version
./publish.ps1 -Version $v -Tag -Github -PSGallery -Chocolatey  #publish everywhere
```

Before publishing, edit the `NEXT` header in the `CHANGELOG.md` file to set the release notes and build the module. The publish script will take first second level header after the `NEXT` (the latest version) as release notes. The publishing will fail if release notes are not found. If that happens, don't forget to edit the file **and commit/push it to repository** in order for next tag to include it.

Publishing procedure depends on number of environment variables. Rename `vars_default.ps1` to `vars.ps1` and set variables there to get them included.
